# Go Fish
Go Fish was my final year project for my dissertation in University.
It was my idea to test my Software Engineering skills to build an interactive card game of Go Fish. The game was built using Java Language on NetBeans IDE.<br>
It is Object-Oriented that I have classes for Players and the Deck of cards.<br>

# The Game Menu
When you first play the game, it will open a menu homepage with the option to play, how to play with instructions, or quit.<br>
If you want to play, there is a choice of how many players you want to play with. The choice are from 2 to 4 player game, with computer players.<br>

# The GamePlay
The game will draw out 5 cards to each player.<br>
When it's your turn, You have to select a player to ask by clicking on one of the buttons on the left side. After that, you need to type the card value into the textbox below the deck.<br>
However, for the face and high valued cards, you have to type following:
<li>Ace = 1</li>
<li>Jack = 11</li>
<li>Queen = 12</li>
<li>King = 13</li><br>
The game will continue playing until all the playing card are in their sets.
